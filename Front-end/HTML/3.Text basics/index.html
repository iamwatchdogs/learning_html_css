        <h1>This is &lt;h1&gt; heading attribute</h1>
        <p>We <strong>SHOULD</strong> use &lt;h1&gt; attribute only once per attribute, it's not like we can't use them multiple times but it's <em>mostly <strong>recommended</strong> to use only once per page</em>.</p>

        <!-- html entity -->
        <!-- Since the < and > symbols are already have a pre-definied meaning in html, So we use &lt; to display < and &gt; to display > in the output html page, This things are called html entity -->

        <!-- There are basically 2 types of elements -->
        <!-- 1. Block-Level element -->
            <!-- These element will automatically generate an return/new-line character at the end of it's content to seperate it as an block -->
            <!-- ex: <p>, <h1>, etc -->
        <!-- 2. Inline-Level element -->
            <!-- These element will not generate any automatically return/new-line character at the end of it's content, since they are not seperating it as an block. But there are used inside a block to give change the characteristics of a specific part of the content. -->
            <!-- ex: <em>, <strong>, etc -->

        <hr> <!-- "<hr>" is an horizontal ruler atribute used to create a rule seperating the content by a horizantal dash/ruler on output page-->

        <h2>This is &lt;h2&gt; header attribute</h2>
        <p>There are several heading attributes to differentiate/represent the difference in the hierachy of the content</p>
