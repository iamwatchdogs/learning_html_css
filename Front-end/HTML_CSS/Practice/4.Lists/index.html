            <dt>Ordered Lists :-</dt>
            <dd>

                <p> Ordered list are the list in which each individual list item ( &lt;li&gt; ) is denoted using (by default) numbers, <br>Just as given below,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First we have to use attribute &lt;ol&gt; to create a list.</li>
                    <li>Then we can add as many list items as we want using &lt;li&gt; attribute.</li>
                    <li>Then it will display the list as seperate point/items denoted by numbers.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In Addition to that, we can also change the types in ordered as roman numbers, alphabets, etc...</p>
                <h3>For example : </h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>First we have to use attribute &lt;ol&gt; to create a list.</li>
                    <li>Then we have to specify the type as ( &lt;ol type = 'a'&gt;, for this example ).</li>
                    <li>Then we can add as many list items as we want using &lt;li&gt; attribute.</li>
                    <li>Then it will display the list as seperate point/items denoted by numbers.</li>
                </ol>

            </dd>

            <dt>Unordered Lists :-</dt>
            <dd>

                <p> Unordered list are the list in which each individual list item ( &lt;li&gt; ) is denoted using (by default) dots, <br>Just as given below,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is similar to the Ordered list but the only different is that, Ordered list uses numbers and Unordered don't.</li>
                    <li>So, First we have to use attribute &lt;ul&gt; to create a list.</li>
                    <li>Then we can add as many list items as we want using &lt;li&gt; attribute.</li>
                    <li>Then it will display the list as seperate point/items denoted by numbers.</li>
